# Take-Home Engineering Challenge: Smart Home Control Panel

**Role:** Generalist Engineer (Fresh Graduate)  
**Duration:** Approx. 2 Days  
**Keyword:** Smart Home

## >� Overview

Create a **Smart Home Control Panel** web app that simulates managing a few smart devices inside a home. This app will reflect a typical IoT use case, allowing you to showcase full-stack development skills with a focus on UI control logic, device state handling, and basic API communication.

## =� Objectives

1. **System Design**
   - Design a basic architecture involving simulated devices, API server, and frontend.
   - Provide a visual diagram or written description of the architecture.

2. **Frontend - Smart Home Dashboard**
   - Use React (or similar) to build a UI that:
     - Lists devices like lights, thermostat, door locks, and cameras.
     - Allows toggling power states (on/off), adjusting temperature, or locking doors.
     - Displays current status of each device.

3. **Backend/API Simulation**
   - Expose endpoints such as `/api/devices` and `/api/devices/{id}` to GET and PATCH device status.
   - Maintain a mock device state store in memory or using a JSON file.

4. **Bonus (Optional)**
   - Simulate periodic updates (e.g., thermostat reading changes every minute).
   - Add user authentication or a simple room-by-room filter.
   - Deploy on a free hosting platform (e.g., Railway, Netlify).

## >� Deliverables

- Source code in a GitHub repo or downloadable zip.
- A `README.md` that includes:
  - Overview of the system architecture.
  - Steps to install and run the project.
  - Screenshot or link to a live demo (if deployed).
- One-paragraph reflection on challenges and improvements.

##  Evaluation Criteria

- Design and functionality of the system.
- Code clarity, modularity, and good use of components.
- Creativity in device simulation and control interface.
- Completeness of implementation and documentation.

**Tip:** Keep your scope reasonable2 to 3 device types is enough. Show how youd extend the system (e.g., real sensors, mobile support, notification system) in the future.
